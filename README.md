 About this project: We work on a system for a company that organizes events. This event is a music festival and will take place on 22nd January at Park Kuierpad. As this event will take place on a big terrain, the organizer is interested in a software solution for the event and wants every thing to run smoothly. Therefore, we have built a solution that contains the following:  A website that informs people about the event and allows reservation of tickets and camping spots and allows the admin to get the clear status of the event. Applications that check visitors in and out of the event and camping Applications that support the shops (food/drinks/souvenirs) and the loan stands An application that changes the balance of the visitors based on the ATM log files An application that help visitors deposit and thus create log files. A database supporting all the applications
